Data Cleaning for Nashville Housing Market
In this Project I took Nashville Housing Market to clean data, fill blank spaces and get all the information ready to be used.
Why Nashville? It´s one of the regions were properties are getting expensier in around a 10,2% while listings are going down 50%.
It seems people are going to Austin, Houston and Dallas to get lower taxes, but also this place is getting a lot of attention.
Media reports that the amount of people living there is going dowm, so they can move to new places, so prices go up for locals trying to get their first home.
Here is a report from Zillow.com, the most used Real Estate platform to buy, sell or rent properties in the US:

Austin is another place to have a look at it, since it´s destination to a lot of families and businesess from California, tired of high taxation.
